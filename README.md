# Time Series Forecasting Implementation in Python

Welcome to my project! This repository is dedicated to transforming the incredible insights found in **Forecasting: Principles and Practice**, a book by Rob J. Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos, into Python-friendly content.

My objective is to enable Python enthusiasts and developers to harness the extensive knowledge encapsulated in this book. This adaptation into Python will provide a convenient avenue for Python users to apply powerful forecasting concepts, strategies, and techniques in a programming language they are comfortable with.

While my work is ongoing, I warmly welcome additional contributors to join us in this endeavor. Your expertise and passion could significantly enhance this project.

This repository is an invaluable tool for Python users of all experience levels, whether they're newcomers to forecasting or seasoned veterans seeking a refresher. 

Strengthen your journey of Python-based forecasting today, and happy forecasting!  
I encourage you to take a look at the official handout **[Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp3)** for understanding forecasting theory and implementation in **R**. This resource, alongside this repository, will help in transitioning forecasting concepts between R and Python.
